The API represents databases, views, view entries, and documents in JSON format.  **Important**: This version of the OpenAPI spec (**data.yaml**) includes data API changes from the XPages Extension Library release 9.0.1.v09_02. This  includes new operations on attachments, agents and forms.  If you are using a version before 9.0.1.v09_02, consider using an earlier version of the spec.   # noqa: E501
